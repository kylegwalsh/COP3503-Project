Errors:
Someone figure out why the random numbers being generated are the same, or maybe it's just my compiler.
See if you can figure out why attack isn't changing the health of the characters (it seems like it should, but it doesn't change the number printed).

Combat:
Attack will return a string that should be saved in the Combat loop and then printed out.
	//if you run this it should produce a rough draft of the combat screen
	int main(){
		Player p;
		Bat b;

		p.PrintCombatStats();
		b.PrintEnemyStats();
		b.PrintAscii();
		cout << "1. Attack  2. Eat  3. Flee" << endl << endl;

		string pAttack=p.Attack(b);
		string eAttack=b.Attack(p);

		p.PrintCombatStats();
		b.PrintEnemyStats();
		b.PrintAscii();
		cout << "1. Attack  2. Eat  3. Flee" << endl;
		cout << pAttack << endl;
		cout << eAttack;
	}

Map:
Player locations (xLocation and yLocation) still need to have the correct int coordinates put in.
