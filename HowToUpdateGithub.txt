How to add files on Github
==========================================
Because Git Pull doesn't always work we're going to completely delete and reclone your directory so that other
people's files aren't overwritten except when they're supposed to be. 

1 - Copy whatever files you have modified or plan to add into a serperate directory
2 - Delete the COP3503 directory
3 - Open the Git Shell app if you're on windows or if you're on Linux/unix just open a terminal
4 - Now we're going to clone the directory, giving you the updated versions of all the files. While in the directory you want 
the project to be located type "git clone https://github.com/kylegwalsh/COP3503-Project"
5- Now add whatever files you want to the COP3503-Project directory.
6- type"cd ./COP*" then "git status" This will tell you which files have been modified
7- If you need to remove a file (and not replace it with an updated version) for some reason type "rm filename"
8- Now that your files are as they should be in the directory type "git add ." which will add all your files, basically telling github that these are intentionally modified.
9-Now we must commit the changes. type (git commit -m "tell us what you changed here. yes the message is mandatory" )
10 - Now you will push the changes you made into the master branch. type "git push origin master"
11- If it tells you it doesnt know who you are or you're not logged in simply follow the error instructions that pop up and try again.
